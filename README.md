# NonceFinder

## Description 
Cycles through APNonces until the desired one is found (hopefully) more efficiently than `-w` on futurerestore. Even so, it will probably take a LONG time, and there is no guarentee it will work in your life time.

## Installation (TBD)
Idk if I'm writing this in bash, C (or its derivatives), or Rust, will update when I figure it out.
